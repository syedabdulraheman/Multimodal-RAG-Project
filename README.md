# Multimodal-RAG-Project
 A Multimodal RAG System with Local AI!   Built a privacy-first document Q&amp;A system that understands BOTH text and images in PDFs - completely running on local hardware with zero API costs!
💡 Solving a Real Problem: Built an AI that reads documents like humans do!

Ever struggled to extract insights from lengthy PDFs with complex charts and images? I built a solution that answers questions about BOTH text and visuals - all while keeping your data private.

🎯 The Problem:
Traditional document search only understands text. But most important documents contain charts, graphs, and images that carry crucial information.

✨ The Solution:
A Multimodal RAG system that:
- Understands questions in natural language
- Searches across text AND images simultaneously
- Generates accurate answers from combined context
- Runs 100% locally (no cloud, no API keys, no costs!)

🛠️ Built With:
State-of-the-art open-source AI models (CLIP, BLIP, FLAN-T5) + Modern vector databases (FAISS) + User-friendly interface (Streamlit)

💪 Why This Matters:
✅ Data Privacy - Enterprise-ready, nothing leaves your machine
✅ Cost-Effective - Zero ongoing costs after setup
✅ Accessible - Anyone can run cutting-edge AI locally

Proud to contribute to democratizing AI technology!
